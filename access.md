**_The access to the cluster is possible only within the IRB network_**

- Connecting from the IRB network - [Access from the RBI network](## Access from the RBI network>).
- Connecting from the outside of the RBI network - [Access from outside the RBI network](## Access from outside the RBI network).

<!--If you access the cluster from outside the RBI network you will first have to establish a VPN connection to RBI. Information on how to use VPN can be found [here](http://helpdesk.irb.hr/wiki/OpenVPN). Once the VPN is established, the cluster can be accessed following the instructions [Access from the RBI network](<# Access from the RBI network>).-->

## Access from the RBI network
### Linux

If you are using any of the Linux operating systems, the cluster can be access from the command line with:

```
ssh <username>orthus.cir.irb.hr
```

and typing your password.

We encourage the access using SSH protocol by using private key rather than password. How to setup ssh access without providing password can be found [here](https://linuxhint.com/ssh-using-private-key-linux/).

## Access from outside the RBI network

If you access the cluster from outside the RBI network you will first have to establish a VPN connection to RBI. Information on how to use VPN can be found [here](http://helpdesk.irb.hr/wiki/OpenVPN). Once the VPN is established, the cluster can be accessed following the instructions [Access from the RBI network](<# Access from the RBI network>).
